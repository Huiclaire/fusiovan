PROJECT NAME
FusioVan - a web app to help aspiring DIY camper van builders choose their appliances and solar energy system components in a user friendly way
Visit the production version at http://www.fusiovan.com/

DESCRIPTION
This project has used the LeWagon Rails Devise template. This template installed everything necessary to go straight into prototyping the application and avoid spending a long time in configuration. As the Rails doctrine states, 'Convention over Configuration'. Heroku was used for deploying the application to production.

The web app allows aspiring DIY camper van builders to browse community built camper van 'builds' or create their own, using the 'Create a build' tool. This tool was made using Javascript and Stimulus. At this stage of the app the existing 'builds' are provided via seeds included in the application files.
